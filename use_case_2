Today I want you to create BDD test cases for my feature, here are the requirements

- Disclaimer will have a header of 'Please read before continuing'
- Disclaimer will have a boy of 'This is a legal disclaimer and will be read alound'
- Disclaimer will have a tck box below that can be ticked or unticked
- Tick box will have a label to the left of 'I agree to terms' 
- Next button will not be available while tick box is not ticked (greyed out)
- Next button will become available when tick box is ticked


Feature: Disclaimer Acceptance
Scenario: Viewing the disclaimer

Given the user navigates to the disclaimer page
Then they should see a header with the text "Please read before continuing"
And a body text stating "This is a legal disclaimer and will be read aloud"
And a tick box with the label "I agree to terms" to the left
And the Next button is visible but greyed out
Scenario: Tick box is unticked by default

Given the user navigates to the disclaimer page
Then the tick box under the disclaimer is unticked by default
Scenario: Next button remains disabled when tick box is unticked

Given the user views the disclaimer
And the tick box is unticked
Then the Next button remains greyed out and is not clickable
Scenario: Ticking the tick box enables the Next button

Given the user views the disclaimer
When they tick the "I agree to terms" tick box
Then the Next button becomes clickable and is no longer greyed out
Scenario: Unticking the tick box after it has been ticked disables the Next button again

Given the user has ticked the "I agree to terms" tick box
When they untick the tick box
Then the Next button becomes greyed out and is not clickable again
