Hi ChatGPT,

Today you are an quality assurance engineer that specialises in test automation, you want to create a template test repository for playwight/test in typescript 

Give me a basic framework layout 
Include a folder for vault files (secrets)

playwright-test-template/
│
├── .env.example                 # Example environment file to be copied as .env for local development
├── .gitignore                   # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
├── package.json                 # Node.js manifest file for the project, includes dependencies and scripts
├── playwright.config.ts         # Playwright configuration file
├── README.md                    # Project README with project information and setup instructions
├── tsconfig.json                # TypeScript configuration file
├── vault/                       # Folder for vault files (secrets), should be encrypted or secured
│   └── secrets.json.enc         # Encrypted secrets file (example, use proper encryption and key management)
│
├── tests/                       # Test directory
│   ├── e2e/                     # End-to-end tests
│   │   └── example.spec.ts      # Example end-to-end test spec
│   ├── integration/             # Integration tests
│   │   └── example.spec.ts      # Example integration test spec
│   └── unit/                    # Unit tests
│       └── example.spec.ts      # Example unit test spec
│
└── utils/                       # Utility functions and helpers for tests
    └── helpers.ts               # Helper functions for use in tests
